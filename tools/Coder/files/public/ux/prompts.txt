html js create a module for for coding editing that can be imported.
There doesent have to be anything exported.
It will have a special tag <textcode> in html.
on load all <textcode> will be replaced with the code editor ux. for any dom added will be detected to see if it is the <textcode> tag and create the code editor.
the code editor will span out in what ever container.
It will have a a div that is editable, do not use textarea for the text container, is a div with attribute editable. It should allows tabs. The tab space will be 4 spaces.
use mono space font. the side will have line numbers that align with the main editor.
There is no wrapping or word wrapping. both the line number section and editor section should use the same mono font,
have the same size, padding size and margin size and any other measerable should be the same.
tabs ar calculated. for every ({[ opening bracket the tabs is added. 
	so when a new line is entered the number of tabs is inserted in the begining of the line.
For all ]}) closing brackets the tabs count is subtracted. if the line ends with a closing bracket and a new line is entered then the line with the closing bracket needs to subtract one tab.
Add a symbile button for beatifying the text. 
this will go thru each line and trim the string, prepend the number of tabs as there are opening and closing brackets.
absolute needed styles needs to be creates when importing, this can be done by dynamicly creating a <style> tag and add it to the html.
Tabs need tonline up. if there is a space then a tab then the spaes for that tab would be 3. This should be done in css styling than coded.
