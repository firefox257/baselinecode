Below defines to Tops program language. 
//Here is a list of primative types. 

bool //boolean
char //character
int1 //signed 8 bit
int2 //signed 16 bit
int4 //signed 32 bit
int8 //signed 64 bit
uint1 //unsigned 8 bit
uint2 //unsigned 16 bit
uint4 //unsigned 32 bit
uint8 //unsigned 64 bit
float4 //float 32 bit
float8 //float 64 bit

bool * //pointer to boolean
char * //pointer to character
int1 * //pointer to signed 8 bit    
int2 * //pointer to signed 16 bit
int4 * //pointer to signed 32 bit
int8 * //pointer to signed 64 bit
uint1 * //pointer to unsigned 8 bit    
uint2 * //pointer to unsigned 16 bit
uint4 * //pointer to unsigned 32 bit
uint8 * //pointer to unsigned 64 bit
float4 * //pointer to float 32 bit
float8 * //pointer to float 64 bit

bool[] //array of boolean
char[] //array of character
int1[] //array of signed 8 bit    
int2[] //array of signed 16 bit
int4[] //array of signed 32 bit
int8[] //array of signed 64 bit
uint1[] //array of unsigned 8 bit    
uint2[] //array of unsigned 16 bit
uint4[] //array of unsigned 32 bit
uint8[] //array of unsigned 64 bit
float4[] //array of float 32 bit
float8[] //array of float 64 bit

//strings are char * or char[].


//there are no for loops, while or do while loops.There is only loop with defined arguments and a break to exit the loop.
//Example below.

loop(int4 i = 0;)
{
    //do other code. 
    i++;
    if(i>=200) break;
    //or do other code.
}

//if , else if and else are the same as c language
Example
if(i < 10)
{
    //do other code. 
}
else if(i < 20)
{
    //do other code. 

}
else 
{
    //do other code. 
}

//switch is the same as c code.
//Example
switch(i)
{
    case 123: 
    //do code
    break;
    case 1:
    //do code
    default:
    //do code
    break;
}

//eswitch only applies to $e+ $e- $e-- enums as the starting value is 0 and is incremented. 
//this allows for further optimizations on the compiler to use a table reference to jump to the appropriate code.
//It is inspected that enum alwasy starts at 0 with a definition and increments with any following defintions. 
eswitch(enumname)
{
    case enumname.red:
    //do code
    break;
    case enumname.green:
    //do code
    break;
    case enumname.blue:
    //do code
    break;      
    default:
    //do code
}
 

====================
Define a javascrip funciton compiler, with an input string of the Tops program langauge. 
The output is a string of webassembly wat text format for the function.
"this" keyword is assumbed to be a pointer to a $heap offset. 

The function should be function makeTopsMemberFunction(memberThis,  arguments)
the memberThis has a definition of the strucure properties with the $heap offset of each property.
memberThis also has a definition of memberFunctions that has the definiion of the member function calls.  


`void try1_get_x(this)
{
    return this._x;
}
`
Where this is memberThis referenced. 

Another example

`
int4 func(this, int4 x)
{
    int4 y = 123;
    x = x + y * 3;
    return x;
}

`

Another example
`
bool test(this)
{

    eswitch(colorType)
    {
        case colorType.red:
        //do code
        return true;

        defualt:
        return false;
    }


}
