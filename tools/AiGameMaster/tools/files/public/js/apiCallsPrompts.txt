for the apiCalls lets add some security.
for every call , get the directory and read #secure.json file.
This json will say if the files/directories in the directiry is readable, writable, delete, createDir, createFile with the following object description in the #secure.json
{
	"read":true,
	"write":true,
	"delete":true,
	"createDir": true,
	"createFile":true
}

If the #secure.json does not exist then we assume that everything is allowed.
One trick part is the path has to do multipule checks on each part with in the path. if one does not allow a particular part then throw an error for it's access.
